# .executor Demo

These are a collection of screenshots from the work-in-progress demo for .executor, a game I'm working on with my studio, Volition Saga.
The primary goals of this project have been to depict a narrative though the game without disrupting the player's experiences, and I did this with two methods:

1. Unintrusive Text Boxes
  - As this is a shooter, the screen cannot be obstructed by opaque text boxes. These text boxes are transparent, with the only fully opaque UI being the speaker profile box as to maximize usable screen space.
2. Out-of-Bounds Storytelling
  - A scene beyond the access of the player. This one in particular shows an experiment on someone using the same effects that the player uses when dashing, implying that this place is the origin of that ability.

The demo itself will be added here at a later date.
